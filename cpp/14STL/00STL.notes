! Standard template library !
STL consists of
=>1. Algorithms         //algorithmic functions for searching and sorting etc.
=>2. Containers         //template classes for all data structures.
=>3. Iterators          //We can use these to iterate over those containers.
=>4. functions          //STL includes classes which overload function call operator. Instances of such classes are called functors.
